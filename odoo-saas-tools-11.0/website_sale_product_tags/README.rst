Product tags at eCommerce
=========================

Adds tags on the product page in a smaller font, just above the suggested alternatives section.
If someone clicks on a tag, it opens a new search using that tag as the search term, i.e. /shop?search=TAG

Note
----
By default /shop?search=TAG search on product name rather than on tags. 
This is fixed by module **website_sale_search_custom**, but latter also change default behaviour on searching by category. Check **website_sale_search_custom**'s description for more information.
